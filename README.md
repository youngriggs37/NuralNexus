     ```

2. **Run the App on an Android Device or Emulator**:
   - Run the app on an Android device or emulator:
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-android
     ```

3. **Run the App on an iOS Device or Simulator**:
   - Run the app on an iOS device or simulator:
     ```sh
     npx react-native run-ios
     ```

#### Step 10: Testing
1. **Run Unit Tests**:
   - Run unit tests:
     ```sh
     npm test
     ```

2. **Run Integration Tests**:
   - Run integration tests:
     ```sh
     npm run test:integration
     ```

#### Step 11: Deployment
1. **Generate a Signed APK (Android)**:
   - Generate a signed APK:
     ```sh
     cd android
     ./gradlew assembleRelease
     ```

2. **Upload the APK to the Google Play Store**:
   - Go to the Google Play Console.
   - Create a new app and upload the generated APK.

3. **Generate an IPA File (iOS)**:
   - Generate an IPA file:
     ```sh
     cd ios
     xcodebuild -scheme YourApp -sdk iphoneos -configuration Release archive -archivePath build/YourApp.xcarchive
     xcodebuild -exportArchive -archivePath build/YourApp.xcarchive -exportOptionsPlist exportOptions.plist -exportPath build
     ```

4. **Upload the IPA to the App Store**:
   - Go to App Store Connect.
   - Create a new app and upload the generated IPA.

#### Step 12: Customization
1. **Customize Editor Settings**:
   - Open the `src/settings.js` file.
   - Modify the settings as needed.

2. **Customize Key Bindings**:
   - Open the `src/keybindings.js` file.
   - Modify the key bindings as needed.

#### Step 13: Troubleshooting
- **App Crashes**:
  - Ensure your device meets the system requirements.
  - Clear the app cache and data from the device settings.
  - Reinstall the application.

- **Git Issues**:
